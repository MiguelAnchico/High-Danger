## High-Danger

High-Danger is a first-person 3D virtual reality game that uses Oculus DK2 and Leap Motion technologies in Unity 5.4.3f1 to create an immersive multimedia experience. The game puts the player in the shoes of an electricity worker who has just returned to work after an electrical incident and needs to repair some high-voltage tower insulators.

### Installation

To run High-Danger, you will need an Oculus DK2 device, a Leap Motion sensor and haptic gloves (optional. private technology make with arduino nano). Follow these steps to get started:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/MiguelAnchico/High-Danger.git`
2. Open the project in Unity 5.4.3f1.
3. Connect your Oculus DK2 and Leap Motion devices to your computer.
4. Build and run the project in Unity.

### Gameplay

In High-Danger, the player must navigate through a virtual environment that simulates a high-voltage tower. The objective is to repair damaged insulators in a very higth and restore the tower's electrical function.

To do this, the player will need to use tools and interact with objects in the environment. The Leap Motion sensor allows for natural hand gestures, enhancing the immersive experience. The haptic gloves simules electric moves.

### Controls

- Look: Move your head to look around the virtual environment.
- Interact: use your hands in front of the leap motion to make your hands appear on the screen. Move your fingers to touch objects and use tools.
- Repair: use the tools to fix the insulators, when you feel the vibration in your haptic gloves you must stay away from electrical currents.

### Contributing

Currently High-Danger does not receive contributions because it is a closed and formative project of the Autonomous University of the West UAO (by its acronym in Spanish). If you want to continue this project, please contact us.
